Based on the analysis we did, it shows home value does correlation with population, age, temperature, income, provety rate, employment rate and crime rate.   
But there is correlation with %Hispanic population and %Black population, based on the current data set.   
  
#### An interesting insight that came up during data exploration...  
Is there a relationship between business establishments, specifically grocery stores, and housing prices?   
Is Whole Foods, a high-end organic supermarket, located in more affluent areas?   
Is Walmart, a low-priced hypermarket, located in lower-income areas?  
  
#### Whole Foods Market and Walmart Locations on Home Value Heatmap

Walmart has more stores in california, but the locations are around lower home value neiborhood.
